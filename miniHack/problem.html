            <p>There are many families in Detroit that live below the poverty line. Most of these families have children that would like to support their families as much as possible. However, many teens don’t know how to make money since they are still young. There are many ways that they can make money and they are unaware of it. They are missing out on possible income for their families, as well as proceeding to live in poor conditions. There aren’t many people attempting to address this issue, and I believe that the impact can change many families in our local area. That is why I have worked on developing a solution to this problem.</p>

            <p>According to patch.com, in 2019, 30.6% of Detroit’s residents live below the poverty line. This is proof that a lot of Detroit isn’t living very well and many of the other residents probably live near the poverty line as well. Patch.com also states that the percentage made Detroit the 2nd poorest city in the country, right before Cleveland. Studies also show that 10% of homes in Detroit do not have running water. This can mean that the residents aren’t making enough money to even pay their bills. This shows that the extra income can really help when it comes to living in Detroit.</p>

            <p>There are solutions to this problem that are not as effective. One of the ways is to simply do a Google search on how to make money as a teenager. The reason this is not effective is because it does not give suggestions based on who the person is or how old they are. Another solution is GDYT, which provides summer programs to teens older than 14. This is not very effective because these programs are limited to teens older than 14, and they are also only available during the summer. While a summer program is effective since teens are out of school, there are still ways for them to make money outside of school.</p>

            <p>My solution is a website that allows teens to type in their age, their work preferences and the times they are available and get results on how to earn money. The website will then provide many ways that said teens can earn money based on their selections. For example, a 16 year old would have working at McDonalds as an option. Not every method is a job, there will be other ways available such as lemonade stands and washing cars. They can also add more specific information about themselves such as when they prefer to work for better results. The website will be very easy to use and understand, since the people using it will be young teenagers. The main goal is to easily find a way to make money that the teen would be interested in, and teach them how they can do it. Another smaller goal is to make the website easy to navigate and make it accessible on mobile devices as well. </p>

            <p>One reason why this solution will work is because currently, teens are in high demand for most jobs in Detroit. According to clickondetroit.com, ages 16-19 had the highest employment rate in April of 2021. Teens will have an easier time finding work because of the high demand for them, and this app will allow them to find which one suits them best. Another reason why this will work is because most teens are already familiar with the internet. According to npr.org, 84% of teens in the United States already have their own smartphone. This means that they should be able to find the website with ease and use it without having any trouble.</p>

            <p>This solution will be available for all teens to use, and college students as well. It can even provide work experience for young teens who are getting their first job, or simply provide an extra source of income. They can also learn skills along the way such as money management if they chose to do so. One of the main purposes of my solution is to help families in Detroit earn more money and decrease the amount of households living in poverty. This solution will help to increase the household income and get them above the poverty line. With both parents and teens working at the same time, there will always be an increase in the household income. This way, the solution benefits everyone, especially young teenagers.</p>
